                <h2>Karin</h2>
                     <p>My name is Karin Bryant, and this is my first class in the last couple years. I have a degree in Biochemistry and worked in the field for 9 years before moving to Portland to start a family. Once our three kids were in school, I completed a <a href=” https://www.pdx.edu/sba/post-baccalaureate-accounting-certificate” target=”_blank”> Post-baccalaureate accounting certificate </a> to before starting paid work as a financial auditor.</p>
                    <p>When we moved to Portland, my husband and I bought a fixer upper which we have been working on for the past 20 years. Otherwise, most of our time is spent with our kids and their activities. In a couple years our youngest will be in college and we hope to do more exploring within Oregon and beyond.</p>

            <div id = "Josh" class ="groupMember">
                <h2>Josh</h2>
                     <p>My name's Josh Bundy, I'm a degenerate weeb who spends too much time at my computer. I've spent the last three years trying to decide what to do with my life, changing career paths multiple times over the last 3 years. I've tried auto mechanics, eletrical trades work, and engineering so far. Now I'm chasing a degree in Computer Science with a plan to go into Game Design in the future.</p>
                    <p>My free time is spent playing video games and trying to stay caught up on the current seasons anime. I don't go out and do things too often, lacking friends to do stuff with. That being said, I also don't like being couped up inside for long periods of time either. When not behind the computer, I like to play with my dog Kipper, a Britany, in the yard.</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Lacy. I am really into video games. I play a lot of different types of games but mostly first-person shooters. The games I play the most now are Red Dead Redemption 2 Online and Call of Duty Modern Warfare Multiplayer.</p>
					<p>I have a 7-year-old German/Dutch Shepherd named Dynomite. I call him Dyno for short. I have had him since he was 4 weeks old. We like to go hiking together and play fetch in the back yard.</p>
