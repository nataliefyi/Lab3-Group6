                    <h2>Natalie</h2>
                        <p>Hi! I'm Natalie Bright, a student at PCC. I'm from Portland, and have lived here for most of my life. I'm currently studying for a dual major Associates degree in Cybersecurity and Computer information Systems.</p>
                        <p>After PCC I hope to get a job either in Software/Web development, or maybe an entry level computer security position. My eventual goal is to do something related to Application Security/Penetration testing/Internal Redteaming/Security Research etc. Basically, I want to be a professional hacker! I've always had an affinity for computers and technology, and I'm especially drawn to the strategic and logical elements of cybersecurity.

                    <h2>Karin</h2>
                        <p>My name is Karin Bryant, and this is my first class in the last couple years. I have a degree in Biochemistry and worked in the field for 9 years before moving to Portland to start a family. Once our three kids were in school, I completed a <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/sba/post-baccalaureate-accounting-certificate" target=”_blank”> Post-baccalaureate accounting certificate </a> to before starting paid work as a financial auditor.</p>
                        <p>When we moved to Portland, my husband and I bought a fixer upper which we have been working on for the past 20 years. Otherwise, most of our time is spent with our kids and their activities. In a couple years our youngest will be in college and we hope to do more exploring within Oregon and beyond.</p>

                    <h2>Josh</h2>
                         <p>My name's Josh Bundy, I'm a degenerate weeb who spends too much time at my computer. I've spent the last three years trying to decide what to do with my life, changing career paths multiple times over the last 3 years. I've tried auto mechanics, eletrical trades work, and engineering so far. Now I'm chasing a degree in Computer Science with a plan to go into Game Design in the future.</p>
                        <p>My free time is spent playing video games and trying to stay caught up on the current seasons anime. I don't go out and do things too often, lacking friends to do stuff with. That being said, I also don't like being couped up inside for long periods of time either. When not behind the computer, I like to play with my dog Kipper, a Britany, in the yard.</p>
